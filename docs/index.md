### 1. Introduction

This project main objective is to learn how to implement an input combo system using C++, the SDL library and pugixml library.

#### 1.1. Presentation blocks

The project is divided by two main sections. On the one hand, the first one includes several essential theorical concepts. This way, we have many options to choose from so we can implement it in our projects. On the other hand, the second one includes the code structure of the implementation, with its explanations of the practical concepts.

Note that there are coding exercises in order to understand the system a lot better and learn it quickly and effectively.

#### 1.2. What is a combo?

Wikipedia's definition of combo is: set of actions performed in sequence, usually with strict timing limitations, that yield a significant benefit or advantage.

This definition is incorrect, in the "usually with strict timing limitations". We'll get into the correct definition soon.

### 2. Deeping into the subject

Let's learn new concepts related to a combo.

#### 2.1. Combo differentiation
